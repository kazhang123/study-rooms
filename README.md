# Inspiration
University classes are online, everyone is at home, and studying is a lonely, solitary activity. We recall fond memories from first year of long evenings spent working and laughing around a table in the commons block. Our favorite haunt was the Gordon Shrum Lounge in the commons block at Place Vanier, a first-year residence at UBC. We just called it "Shrum". Group study is not only enjoyable, but also beneficial. Evidence suggest that studying with friends increases learning retention, motivates students to study, and that working together, students in study group generally learn faster than students working alone. Our efforts to recapture that dynamic in a pandemic world have resulted in our web application, SHROOM. Hosted on Heroku, SHROOM is an online space created with the ZOOM API for students to study, collaborate, and socialize. There are four ZOOM rooms available to join 24/7 which open directly in the browser, no account or sign-in required.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
